# guitar-gui-pyqt

Another (much better) shot at making a control GUI for the guitar project. As of 1/8/2021 I have no plans to continue to develop this controller software further as we found that using off-the-shelf MIDI software (like Musescore) works just fine, even with so many guitars.

Note to future self: organize this gui mess. it's almost like people use statically typed languages for a reason
